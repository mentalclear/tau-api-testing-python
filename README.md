## API testing in Python 

This is a repo for TAU course API testing in Python

#### I find it more fun like this:

Instead of pipenv I'll be using venv virutal environment

Instead of Pycharm I'll be using VSCode.

I'll be using a random user API https://randomuser.me instead of 
the one that is used in the course.
